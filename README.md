# python-to-do-list-app
A full-featured to-do list application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Python's Tkinter library. This project allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete, with all tasks automatically saved to a file for persistence. It's a great example of building an interactive and practical desktop application.
